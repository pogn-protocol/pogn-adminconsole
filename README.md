# Poker and Other Games on Nostr

In order to decentralize the poker industry we need a proof of concept which is modular enough to evolve into a full fledged protocol in which other poker sites and skin’s can use for the basis of their projects.

With regard to poker the solution required for cryptographically secure gaming interaction the problem to be addressed is the implementation of mental poker protocols.
